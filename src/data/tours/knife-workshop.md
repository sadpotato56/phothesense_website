In this hands-on knife making workshop, you’ll join their daily rhythm of fire and steel. 
Guided step by step by the artisan and your local tour guide, you’ll transform a simple piece of steel into a personal knife: heating it in the roaring forge, hammering it to shape, sharpening it on the grinding stone, carving and fitting your own handle and finally engraving your name on the blade.

By the end, you won’t just bring home a knife — you’ll carry a story of resilience, craft, and the joy of creation.
