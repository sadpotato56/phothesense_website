Guided by a passionate Coffee Master, you’ll brew six authentic Vietnamese coffee styles — from bold black and classic “brown” condensed milk coffee to Hanoi’s legendary egg coffee, tropical coconut coffee, smooth white coffee, and intriguingly complex salt coffee.

Along the way, you’ll hear stories behind each recipe, uncover the culture of Vietnamese coffee, and pick up local insights to explore Hanoi like a seasoned insider.

A seasonal Hanoi delicacy is thoughtfully paired to elevate this full sensory experience.
